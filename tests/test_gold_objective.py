============================
Guards on the gold-scoring path (`--gold-column`) and on the frame alignment the
offline diff report depends on.

Both halves exist for the same reason: this repository's recurring failure mode
is a harness that returns a confident number about something other than what it
claims to measure. A gold column that silently falls back to the pipeline's own
labels, or a diff report that compares row N against row M, are that failure mode
in two new places.
